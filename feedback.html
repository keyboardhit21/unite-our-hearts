		<P align=justify>As stated in the <A href="about.html">About</A> preamble to this website, "Yached Levavenu / Unite Our Heart is organized for the purpose of facilitating the regathering of all the tribes of Israel as prophesied in the Tanach, / the Hebrew Scriptures." A vital part of that effort is to collect feedback from the site's readers, i.e. of those who identify with Brit Am's message and undertake Unite Our Heart's challenges to repentance and invitation to its prayer projects. This feedback will be shared with the website's readers featuring answers to prayers readers receive from the G-d of Israel concerning the tasks enumerated in the Foundation Articles and Repentance articles. <BR><BR>YL believes that sharing feedback from its readers and <I>feedback from G-d </I>to the returnees of the Ten Tribes is essential to speed our "coming alive" process depicted in Ezekiel 37. <BR><BR>YL also welcomes feedback from its readers about the articles in general, about how readers are impacted by them, and of course about suggestions for improvements. <BR><BR>If you are, or want to be on fire about the regathering of Israel, and about furthering repentance of all the tribes, whether out of <I>love of Israel / ahavat Israel</I> or due to wanting to avoid or to mitigate the harsh wake-up calls that are coming upon all Israel, please partake of YL projects and pray fervently for <I>the spirit of repentance</I> to be poured out upon all Israel. Also, please send us the all-important feedback about what you are doing about these projects and what the G-d of Avraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov is communicating to you once you have undertaken YL's recommendations and projects. </P>
		<P align=left>Please note that YL's collection of articles is designed to be an integrated whole message, where each article is conceptually interconnected with all others.&nbsp; To build a comprehensive understanding of the site's message, as well as of each article, it is recommended that all articles be read before feedback is sent.&nbsp; YL Gratefully welcomes all feedback, including of those who do not partake of its projects.&nbsp; We want to know how we impact all readers.</P>
