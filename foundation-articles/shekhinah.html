		Hosts." </font> </P>
		<P class=passage-ref><font size="4">- Zech. 4:6 </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">The name <i>Shekhinah</i> is related to the word <I>shaken</I> / 
		<i>neighbor or inhabitant.</i>&nbsp; The latter meaning is implied in in Hos. 
		10:5, &quot;The <i>inhabitants </i>of Samaria shall fear.&quot; As<i> neighbor, shaken </i>may 
		designate those that are friendly (Ex. 3:22; Ruth 4:17) or unfriendly (Ps. 
		44:13, [H 14]; 79:4,12). As such, we can see that this word relates to a 
		&quot;presence&quot; implying <i>nearness </i>and <i>closeness,</i> that is tied to a 
		<i>nearby&nbsp; locality</i>, e.g. among his people, (Ex. 
		25:8), on Mt. Zion, (Ps. 74:2), His name dwells in Jerusalem, (Deut. 12;11), and 
		will dwell in Jerusalem, (Zech. 8:3). The word <i>Shekhinah,</i> does not appear 
		in the Bible, but was coined based on related words which describe G-d's 
		Presence in the Bible. The word <i>Shekhinah </i>is a noun, and is based on the 
		Biblical verb &quot;shakan,&quot; (shin, chaf, nun), and other related verbal forms that 
		can mean &quot;abide, abide, dwell in, stay among, cause to dwell, live among.&quot; 
		It can pertain to the physical manifestations of G-d dwelling in the land, e.g.&nbsp; Ex. 24:16, 40:35, 
		Psalm 85:9, [H 10] or dwelling in the cloud, e.g. Num. 9:17-18, 22, 10:12, Job 3:5. 
		(See TWOT articles 7837, 7837a). The related word <i>mishkan, </i>often less accurately&nbsp; 
		translated as &quot;tabernacle&quot; is better translated more literally as &quot;dwelling 
		place&quot; or &quot;abode.&quot;</font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Through the centuries the sages of Yehudah tried to formulate the complex concept of the Shekhinah into succinct definitions. 
		In the Encyclopedia Judaica we are informed, &quot;According to Saadiah Gaon [882-942 
		C.E.], the Shekhinah is identical with <i>kevod ha-Shem (the glory of G-d),</i> 
		which served as an intermediary between God and man.&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggests 
		that the <i>&quot;glory of G-d&quot;</i> is the Biblical term, and Shekhinah the Talmudic 
		term for the created splendor of light which acts as an intermediary between God 
		and man, and which sometimes takes on human form. Thus when Moses asked to see 
		the glory of God, he was shown the Shekhinah, and when the prophets in their 
		visions saw G-d in human likeness, what they actually saw was not G-d Himself, 
		but the Shekhinah (see Saadiah's interpretation of Ezekiel 1:26, I Kings 22:19, 
		and Daniel 7:9 in Book of Beliefs and Opinions 2:10).&quot;</font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">During the prophetic experience, i.e. from the 
		time of Moses till the times of the Prophets, it was the physical manifestation 
		of the Presence of G-d in our time-space continuum.&nbsp; As such, we can 
		conceptualize it as the means of the visible manifestation of God's Presence in 
		our three-dimensional world.&nbsp; For us moderns, we could call it a Divinely 
		created &quot;interface&quot; with humans.&nbsp; Maimonides, (1135-1204), taught that the Shekhinah is &quot;the light of the glory of
		G-d.&quot;&nbsp; Some say the term <I>Shekhinah</I> signifies &quot;the perceivable majestic presence of
		G-d among mankind and expresses the principle of G-d’s indwelling omni-presence in all creation.&quot; 
		In this regard it is important for us to note that the Shekhinah is the &quot;physical&quot; 
		manifestation of God's Presence, and is not to be confused with the spiritual, 
		infinite, heavenly Presence of God, that we cannot possibly conceive. Solomon 
		referred to this heavenly, omniscient Presence that no earthly construction can 
		contain: </font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">&nbsp; <font color="#000080"><i>But will God in 
		very truth dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot 
		contain Thee; how much less this house that I have builded!&nbsp;
		<font face="Trebuchet MS">- </font>I Kings 8:27 (JPS)</i></font></font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Mystics have viewed her as the channel through which Divine light passes into the world. It is also associated with the agency of inspiration and prophecy. It is the inspiring power manifesting in one's conscience as the 
		<i> <FONT color=#000000>Bat Kol /</FONT> Daughter</i> <i>Voice.</i> Overall, the late Aggadata 
		statement in the Talmud is the essential summary of all these points and of what we now need to note: "Come and see how beloved Israel is before
		G-d, for wherever Israel went into exile, the Shekhinah went with them." This 
		statement is based on Ez. 
		11:16, which is written for us to show us that though it was less perceivable, our 
		very survival and guidance throughout history was through the agency of the 
		Shekhinah:
		</font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000080">
		<i>&quot;Therefore say: Thus saith the Lord GOD: Although I have removed them far off 
		among the nations, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet 
		have I been to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they are come;&quot;
		</i></font>
		</font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Ezekiel witnessed this departure of the Glory / Kavod 
		of the Lord from the holy Temple (Ez. 10:18-19). The Kavod never returned to the 
		Second Temple in that full manifestation.&nbsp; Though it was present to a 
		lesser degree in the there, it left from there too and to this day &quot;she&quot; mutually shares in our exile. &nbsp; This in itself is something serious and disturbing we need 
		to contemplate. Today the holy Spirit though not 
		manifesting publicly in a spectacular way as in the days of old, is always accessible 
		by us and is always available&nbsp;for us, though in a more muted way. God never shuts Himself off completely 
		from those who seek Him. Indeed, the Midrash’s romantic-sounding statement tells us that the Divine 
		Guidance, with all its aforementioned attributes always was and even now is available to Israel. 
		As her name implies <i>closeness and nearness,</i> she is with us now, but has to be sought out. The Shekhinah has also been defined as the &quot;hidden Divine 
		Providence.&quot;&nbsp; Early sages basing their conclusions on Lev 16:16, said the Shekhinah, though concealed or muted in its manifestation, was to dwell among the exiled children of Israel even in their impurity (Yoma 56b, Megillah 29a). 
		We can see here through such love for Israel, G-d’s hand, 
		though hidden, was to shape
		Israel's fate and guide them to their destiny, throughout their entire history, (Amos 9:9).
		</font></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Both rabbinic reflection and mystical literature agree that there is an intimate connection between the Shekhinah and the people of Israel. Though they are different perspectives, they both refer to G-d’s active presence being present everywhere in creation, (Bava Bathra 25a). In rabbinic conception, the Shekhinah is the manifestation of G-d’s <I>presence</I>, i.e. it is 
		&quot;the holy Spirit of G-d by which man can feel 
		and see G-d’s presence<i>.&quot; </i>This definition is based on the Bible, where we 
		first encounter the &quot;Shekhinah&quot;<i> </i>when the Israelites set out from Succoth 
		in their escape from Egypt. There it appeared as a pillar of cloud&nbsp; in the 
		day and a pillar of fire by night:</font></P>
		<P align=justify><i><font size="4" color="#000080">And they took their journey 
		from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. And the LORD 
		went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night 
		in a pillar of fire, to give them light; that they might go by day and by night: 
		the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from 
		before the people. <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font><font face="Trebuchet MS">-</font> 
		Exodus 13:20-22 (JPS).</font></i></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Rabbinic teachings maintain that &quot;Whenever the children of Israel gather for worship, where ever judges sit at court, even when one man studies the Torah, the Shekhinah is said to be present,&quot; (Berakhot 6a). Often the terms 
		<i>Shekhinah </i>and <i>Ruach haKodesh </i>[holy Spirit] are used interchangeably to denote the Divine Presence in the form of revelation and inspiration.&nbsp; In the Zohar, the Shekhinah is defined dynamically as <B>
		&quot;G-d’s face</B> turned toward creation.&quot;
		It is that aspect of G-d's Light that dictates to everything of what form it is supposed
		to be in the physical universe.&nbsp; It is the &quot;life force&quot; that animates and
		underlies the very laws of nature.&nbsp; Based in this principle, popular 
		culture has morphed this force in nature as &quot;Mother Nature.&quot; However, the Shekhinah is not a person, 
		e.g. the Angel of God's Presence,&nbsp; but is defined as<I> G-d’s manifest power 
		which has a feminine polarity, an aspect of 
		the Divine life force&nbsp;with which G-d <B>interfaces</B> 
		with humanity</I>. "She," so to speak, comprises all the functions and dynamics of this Divine power for our benefit. In the 
		sephirotic tree, the blueprint of the flowchart of energies in the cosmos, it is the sephirah [conduit] of 
		Malkuth (Kingdom), through which the <b><i>flow</i></b> of Divine light touches the world in general and Israel in particular.&nbsp; 
		For this reason in visions and dreams it may be depicted as a &quot;stream of flowing 
		liquid light.&quot; This portal has also been called <I>Knesset [congregation of] Israel.</I>&nbsp;
		Because of this identification, the people of Israel are understood to eventually become the mystical embodiment of the Divine Presence in the world. Because the Shekhinah’s polarity is female, this is a female embodiment, and is one reason why Israel is referred to by feminine personifications in the Tanach. Our mother Rachel has been traditionally viewed as the type and symbol of the
		Shekhinah who is searching for her children, (Jer. 31:15).&nbsp; Ideally and ultimately, Israel is to be <I>ensouled by</I> the Shekhinah, Israel’s 
		sanctified collective soul.
		This is why this feminine principle of Divine Providence is called <i>Em Habanim,</i>
		Mother of Children, &quot;the Mother of Souls of Israel.&quot; Because of this female polarity the Holy of Holies was called the <I>bridal chamber,</I> for the Shekhinah,&nbsp; 
		the manifest Presence of G-d, dwelt there. </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Israel was commanded to build a sanctuary for G-d, that He might <I>dwell in / among</I> them, (Ex. 25:8). The Mishkan was to be a working model, physical symbol and direct immediate expression of that directive. It was to be a microcosm of the world we live in, affording us to clearly feel the Divine Presence. However, the command was not limited to the portable Mishkan, the initial working model and ceremonial center. Over time, the nation of Israel was to be built and fashioned into <I>the</I> 
		<i>Mishkan </i>of
		G-d’s presence in the world. That readying process has been going on for thousands of years. That purification process for this eventuality is the history of Israel. Her training and preparation for the priesthood as the firstborn of G-d are the hard lessons for Israel to learn throughout the millennia. That training period will culminate in the repentance of Israel, her regathering and return to her Husband and her reacceptance of the Covenant, i.e. the Torah, [the marriage contract]. This time it will be incorporated into her very being, i.e. written on the tables of her rectified 
		and truly repentant heart, (Jer. 24:7, 31:33, 32:40). It is then that the</font><FONT color=#0000ff size=4> <A href="quintessential_lesson.html">quintessential lesson</A></FONT><font size="4"> for Israel will have been learned: <B>
		"And you shall know that I am the L-RD," </B>(Hos. 2:20, Jer. 31:34). It is then 
		and only then the idols in our hearts will be removed and displaced by what 
		ultimately belongs there, the holy Spirit of God, (Ez. 14:1-11). </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Just as the Mishkan was built in the wilderness, Israel is to build <I>the Mishkan of prayers</I> in the wilderness of the nations today. As 
		the Divine Presence came to dwell in the 
		</font> <A href="mishkan.html">
		<FONT color=#0000ff size=4>Mishkan</FONT><font size="4">,</font></A><font size="4"> / Tabernacle,

Just as the Shekhinah guided Israel from Egypt to Mt. Sinai, likewise it is to guide the latter day return
		process and the regathering of all the Tribes of Israel (Meg. 29a). Today, &quot;she&quot; is also to guide the early returnees who are on the way to reaccept the Covenant now. As the Shekhinah guided the leaders of Israel then to serve the masses of Israel, likewise G-d is now calling forth a few to leadership training for the regathering task ahead. </FONT></P>

		This &quot;face&quot; the mystics identify as the&nbsp; &quot;feminine&quot; representative of the&nbsp; 
		&quot;female&quot; aspect of G-d.&nbsp; As such, when &quot;she&quot; joins our souls, she &quot;polarizes&quot; 
		our souls and enables us to be &quot;receptive.&quot;&nbsp; This process is ordained by God, so 
		that like a woman affects a man, we may by &quot;her&quot; powers attract understanding 
		into us, into the depths of our will.&nbsp; Through that mechanism we humans can thus 
		be further &quot;enlivened&quot; and&nbsp; &quot;empowered,&quot; to do His Work, and bring forth &quot;good 
		fruit.&quot;&nbsp; In short, when this Spirit of G-d, which has a feminine polarity, joins 
		our spirit, &quot;she&quot; &quot;polarizes&quot; our spirit to be able to truly &quot;receive.&quot; It 
		speaks to our souls in a soft voice:</font></P>

		<P align=justify><font size="4">It creates in us the rectified will to receive 
		in order to give.&nbsp; Otherwise we remain &quot;unregenerate&quot; and want to receive only 
		for selfish reasons for our own power, aggrandizement and glory.&nbsp; The &quot;power&quot; of 
		the Holy Spirit enables us to truly receive in order to truly give.&nbsp; Thusly we 
		become more like our Father, who is the ultimate giver. </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">The mystics teach us that the spark and flow if Divine energy 
		is active and dominant in the higher realms.&nbsp; As such, for our human 
		understanding, it has a &quot;male&quot; polarity.&nbsp;With this &quot;male 
		polarity&quot; God reveals himself to us as &quot;G-d the giver.&quot; The Shekhinah when it 
		indwells us, is the inner presence of G-d in the heart.&nbsp; As such it &quot;ensouls&quot; 
		us and with this feminine polarity that acts as &quot;G-d the receiver.&quot;&nbsp; Paradoxically, in our world that 
		energy is passive and must be acted upon. As such, for our understanding, it can 
		be likened to a &quot;female&quot; polarity that must be engaged by our actions to benefit 
		from her interaction with us. From our perspective in this world, the Shekhinah's energy is basically passive and must be acted upon 
		by doing the mitzvot / commandments commanded in the Torah for Israel. Doing so, we bring out 
		the potential of the Shekhinah's concealed energy into our individual and 
		collective lives. We can do so and "draw her down" by the keeping of the
		commandments and by asking G-d to imbue us with &quot;her&quot; as the leading and
		guiding edge of our Souls. The awareness of &quot;her&quot; soft voice, is the 
		&quot;inspiration&quot; of G-d's Guiding 
		Presence within us. It increases as we work with the Torah's commandments to give 
		rather than receive. This process is dependent on giving up our own native 
		demanding inner voice with which all humans are born. From infancy it demands 
		that we receive for ourselves alone.&nbsp; By G-d's plan to raise us as His 
		children, we are to learn to receive&nbsp; in order to give to others. G-d is 
		the greatest giver.&nbsp; If we listen to His Shekhinah's voice within us, we 
		will further His purpose to &quot;ensoul&quot; us with His essence as our Father.
		</font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">That concealed energy is an aspect of the Divine Life Force 
		that is to empower us, (Zech. 4:6). Paradoxically, when acted upon, it &quot;leads 
		and empowers&quot; our passive souls, and pairs us with the masculine energy from the 
		Higher realms to enable us to be partakers of the
		<a href="message_of_elijah.html">Work</a> He has set 
		before us. With such synergy motivating us, we can become partakers of the mission
		G-d gave us, to improve our world by becoming channels of G-d
		consciousness into the world. This kind of&nbsp; <i>revelation</i> and the
		drawing down of the Shekhinah is the part that G-d gives to man to be partakers 
		of His Work to bring about
		His kingdom.&nbsp; Through repentance, observance of the mitzvot / commandments,
		focused concerted prayer and right action, we can influence her return into the lives of all Israel. For
		this reason the sages of Yehudah teach us that &quot;He who studies the Torah
		with the aim of fulfilling its precepts is worthy to receive the holy
		Spirit&quot; (Lev. R. XXXV.7). This is our general task as the priestly nation, the firstborn among the children of
		G-d.&nbsp; It is also the particular task of the first contingent in our times to be awakened
		by the Creator from the Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37). As He gave the Ruach ha-Kodesh to Joshua and Caleb, 
		he is waiting now to give His guiding Presence,
		the holy Spirit to the early hearers of His wake-up call. These early returnees are needed

		<P align=justify><font size="4">This message is part of the &quot;coming alive 
		process&quot; in Ezekiel 37. Though the bones have come together, and the bodies 
		stand on their feet, they say: &quot;Our hope is gone.&quot; Why? Because &quot;coming alive to 
		the extent of&nbsp; knowing their identity as Israel is not enough. Because they 
		are NOT connected to their true &quot;lifeline&quot; from G-d which brings them &quot;truly 
		alive&quot; as G-d intends. That &quot;lifeline&quot; is the holy Spirit of G-d, that is to 
		combine with our spirit, form it, shape it, lead it, suffuse it, and ultimately 
		to &quot;ensoul&quot; us with it in a new way.&nbsp; Without it, we are just so many &quot;zombies&quot; 
		as it were, who have come out of the grave, but are not truly &quot;alive.&quot;&nbsp; Without the enlivening and empowering 
		assistance of the holy Spirit / Shekhinah of G-d, we will not know what to do 
		much less be able to do it. we need to realize that this is <b><i>G-d's Work </i>
		</b>into which we have been drafted. If Zerubbabel was told that he needed the 
		Power of G-d's Spirit to do the restoration in his time, (Zech. 4:6), how much 
		more will we, who have been in 2700 (!) years of idolatry need the same 
		assistance to be loosed from our idols and partake of the restorative Work of 
		EliY-h at the end of days?!... Such contemplation tells us what to do.&nbsp; It 
		is &quot;this [Shekhinah] Face&quot; which we are to seek, for without it we cannot find 
		our way home from the wilderness of the nations' religions, isms, beliefs and 
		mindsets. With this &quot;Shekhinah to &quot;guide&quot; us we cannot truly repent and truly 
		return to G-d, root out the idols from our hearts / psyches,&nbsp; be taught and 
		empowered by Him, and become His servants in the Great Restoration to come, 
		which has already begun.&nbsp; This is why G-d tells us in the Book of Hosea, 
		expressly written to the Ten Tribes in the &quot;latter days:&quot; </font> </P>
