		<P><B><font size="4">It is a place in time and space. </font> </B></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Yached Levavenu's overall purpose is to enlist the efforts of all those awakening Israelites called to know their identity at this time to begin to build the Mikdash / sanctuary for God's guiding Presence, (II Chron.6: 38-42, 7:14).&nbsp;&nbsp;
		This is not a call to build a physical
		edifice at any physical place. Rather, it is a call to build the <I>spiritual sanctuary of prayers, a
		<b> virtual</b>  Mishkan / Tabernacle, out of the aggregate prayers of all concerned members
		of the tribes of Israel. It is to serve as&nbsp; the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, for homeward bound Israel. </I>God tells us that He is enthroned on and dwells in, i.e.
		<b> <I>inhabits</I> the prayers of His people </b> (Psalm 22:5). <SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">It is hoped at Yached Levavenu that <I>the virtual Mishkan of prayers</I> will serve as its name implies, a tent of <I>meeting and communication</I> between the God of Israel and his people seeking repentance and
		restoration.</SPAN> 
		It is a <b>current</b> effort to marshal the focused, specific-content prayer of
		all returnees in order to aid in the return process of klal / whole Israel, even
		those who are not yet called home.&nbsp; We desire to facilitate a form of
		&quot;communal&quot; prayer despite our diverse situations, asking that HaShem
		guide us and <i>unite the heart of all Israel </i>to return to Him,
		<a href="quintessential_lesson.html">
		the only God of Avraham, Yitzhak and Yaakov.</a>&nbsp; Yached Levavenu promotes
		the seeking of this Guidance to guide and direct us in our repentance in order
		to return to the Covenant we all made at Mt. Sinai. God's guiding Presence has guided Israel of old in their eastward movement through the wilderness of Sin to the Land. It is hoped that His Guiding Presence will prompt us in similar, albeit more efficient trek, from 
		&quot;the wilderness of
		<i>sin </i>in the West&quot; to <a href="../repentance/turn_us_again.html"> repentance</a> 
		and the Land. Ordinarily, it would be a stretch, linking the Hebrew &quot;sin&quot; to the 
		English &quot;sin.&quot;&nbsp; However, it is the assertion of Yached Levavenu that
		a majority of prophetic Ephraim resides in the English-speaking West. (Hos. 
		11:10, 13:15, Isa. 49:12,&nbsp; 59:19, Zach. 8:7).&nbsp; Perhaps it is
		a fitting hint.&nbsp; </font> </P>
		<P align=justify> <font size="4">This call is going to all members of Israel of the returning Ten Tribes, and of course to those of Yehudah who feel moved to participate and lend their help. All the Tribes need God's active guidance for the tasks ahead. The call is patterned after Ex. 35: 21, 25, where men and women, "all those whose heart stirred them up, and <B>were made willing</B>, brought to the Lord's offerings, i.e. possessions and skills, for the building of the Mishkan of the congregation. We take patterns, pointers and directives from the building of the physical Mishkan in the wilderness. We know that every aspect of the Mishkan is a lesson in the service of God. Some of these will have a correspondence to the building and function of the virtual Mishkan advocated here. 
		</font> </P>
		<P align=justify><FONT size=4><B>Why build it? </B></FONT></P>
		<P align=justify><B><font size="4">For guidance in coming together and in returning to the Covenant. 
		</font> </B></P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">God himself tells us why He had Israel build the Mishkan: "Let them make a sanctuary for me - that I may <B>dwell</B> among them," (Ex. 25:8). His interfacing <I>Presence </I>between Himself and mankind,</font><I><font size="4">
		</font><FONT color=#0000ff size=4><A href="shekhinah.html">the Shekhinah </A></FONT> </I>
		<font size="4">would manifest there in a physical way, for <B>guiding communication</B> in the wilderness for the homeward bound tribes, (Ex. 29:38-42, Lev. 1:1). It was to be the holy place, a <B>Beit El </B>/ a House of God, a kind of portable Sinai, where Israel could sense God's Presence in order to access God's guiding revelation. Isaiah is admonishing today's returnees of Israel, to look to our father Avraham and to our mother Sarah, (Isa. 51:1-5). Avraham alone was called to the Eternal in the midst of utter idolatry. Avraham responded by <B>interfacing</B> with G-d, i.e. <B>dialoging,</B> arguing, bargaining, and thusly became the "friend of God."&nbsp; In essence he invited the transcendent Eternal One
		back into a perceivable and knowable Presence in the world.<I>&nbsp; </I>The Book of Hosea, written expressly to the awakening Ten Tribes of Israel, reminds us that "</font><I><font size="4">our father Yaakov 
		</font><A href="../prayer-projects/prayer/prayer_as_communication.html">
		<FONT color=#0000ff size=4>wept</FONT><font size="4">,</font></A><font size="4"> and made supplication unto Him, he <B>found</B> Him <B>at
		Beit El,</B> and there </font> <B><font size="4">He <A href="message_of_elijah.html">spoke </A>with us.</font></B></I><FONT size=4>" <I>(Hos. 13:4). </I>The Scriptures indicate that we will also be spoken to and answered again, in our time, when we sincerely seek Him with our whole heart
		on our way to
		Beit El, the House of G-d.&nbsp; For this reason we seek to build the Mishkan of Prayers. The God of Yaakov promises to guide us in our time of distress in the way we need to go, as He guided our father Yaakov in the way he went, (Gen.35: 3). The journeys and stops along the way of return of the many individuals who comprise the peoples of Joseph may differ from each other. However, the commonality is that we have all broken and forsaken the Covenant, we have all conformed to the ways of the nations whom we set out to imitate. Therefore, all the routes of return will have the common thread of heading toward the goal of returning to ever-increasing faithfulness to the Covenant.

		Yached Levavenu uses the symbolism of the <i>Mishkan </i>and the<i> lechem panim</i>

		twelve showbreads&nbsp; represented the Twelve Tribes before God in His intimate
		sanctuary for the Tribes' sustenance in the wilderness
		of Sinai. They could be described as the perfect synthesis of the relations
		between Divine Providence and His Tribes, at once representing&nbsp; physical
		sustenance and physical limitation: &quot;...know that man does not live by
		bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God does man
		live.&quot; (Deut. 8:3).&nbsp; Man must do his share of work and know from Whom

		ALL the Tribes. Secondarily, Yached Levavenu musters those called to know about
		the identity of the returning Ten Tribes, to participate in special prayer projects

		<P align=justify><B><font size="4">Taking <a href="message_of_elijah.html"> Elijah's challenge<u>

		<P align=justify><font size="4">Building this virtual Mishkan of prayers is a collective effort as was the original Mishkan the collective effort of the entire nation of Israel. It is voluntary, as when Moshe was told: "speak to the children of Israel and take offerings from me, from every man
		<b> whose heart moves him </b> shall you take offerings," (Ex 25; 1-2). It is to be built, supported, and fueled by those who want to go beyond just knowing the identity of the returning Lost Ten
		Tribes to the imperatives in the Torah and the messages to us in the books of
		the Prophets.&nbsp; The focus is not on private sectarian agendas, but exclusively on the
		guiding Presence to be drawn down into our <a href="../prayer-projects/prayer/prayer_as_communication.html">prayers</a>
		to guide our return and reunification. The only agenda is fostering greater
		receptivity for Divine Guidance so that we may contribute to the speedy return of the Ten Tribes to Torah
		observance. </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">Though growing in numbers, at this time these "early pioneers, are few," one from a city, two from a family, (Jer. 3:14). Yached Levavenu maintains that these small lots and numbers of early returnees are mentioned in the
		Prophets for a specific purpose of service in the return process of the rest of Ten Tribes. Their task is operational before the great vast movements of <I>waking up</I> and <I>returning.&nbsp;</I>
		Perhaps you are one of these early pioneers whose heart is stirred up to build the Mishkan of Prayers. If so, recognize that this animating spark has come from the G-d of Israel, (Jer. 50:20).&nbsp;
		Realize that He gave you that power to use in His service. Ask Him if it is
		time.... your time, to act in that capacity now. </font> </P>
		<P align=justify><font size="4">We envision that along the way to final reunification in the Land, we will come into increased compliance with the Covenant. We also look forward to coming into
		more individual and corporate spiritual healing, and into subsequent fellowship with each other within our respective groups as well as with Yehudah. The diverse backgrounds and settings of our captivity in <FONT color=#0000cd><A href="http://www.lttn.org/R4_Article2_SteveMathe_Chanukah.htm">Galut Edom-Yavan</A></FONT> color our perceptions of what ought to be and give rise to protracted

		<FONT color=#0000ff size=4>controversies</FONT></A><FONT color=#0000FF size=4> </FONT>
		<FONT size=4>and confusions. They can all be clarified when we appeal to Divine

		<FONT color=#0000ff size=4><A href="message_of_elijah.html">message of Elijah </A>&nbsp;</FONT><FONT size=4>challenges 
		all of us to do that. As we converge on our individual roads to Yerushalayim, we will recognize each other more and more and come into the unity that the Prophets depict and hopefully Yached Levavenu envisions and fosters. At this time we are just dry bones coming together. Our
		&quot;dry&quot; bones need the animating Spirit of God to speedily ensoul us, (Ez. 37). The God of our fathers is calling us to wake us up to who we are. Let us respond with our</FONT><FONT color=#0000ff size=4> <A href="../prayer-projects/prayer/prayer_as_communication.html">prayers</A> </FONT>
