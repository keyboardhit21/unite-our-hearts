		mainly on historical evidence, Biblical proof, and current evidence on the
		identity of Lost Tribes of Israel.&nbsp; Yached Levavenu / Unite Our Heart.com&nbsp;
		is parallel in spirit to the purposes of Brit Am, <a href="http://www.britam.org/declaration.html">http://www.britam.org/declaration.html</a>,

		<p align="left">This site is unique in all the world.&nbsp; 
		It is dedicated to &quot;the great restoration&quot; prophesied in the Tanach, the Torah, 
		the Prophets and the&nbsp; Writings.&nbsp; This &quot;restoration&quot; is of all the 
		scattered, cast out and exiled tribes of Israel, to be regathered at the end of 
		the present age. Specifically, it is concerned with the &quot;the-end-of-days&quot; 
		regathering of the so-called &quot;lost Ten Tribes,&quot; the northern house of Israel, 
		often called &quot;Ephraim&quot; in the books of the Prophets.&nbsp; The site maintains 
		that these returning Ten Tribes, and those gentiles who will join them, are to 
		be regathered to each other as written on &quot;the stick of Joseph and his 
		companions&quot; in Ezekiel 37:16.&nbsp; Further this site proclaims that this &quot;camp&quot; 
		is to be gathered to the Core Biblical / Abrahamic Faith of the Torah, called by 
		Jeremiah the "good way" among the ancient paths, ( Jeremiah 6:16).&nbsp; The 
		site's &quot;gathering&quot; called, Synagogue Without Walls&quot; broadcasts teachings on 
		Shabbat and promotes social and study-related networking among its members. All 
		members are at diverse stations on their homeward trek to the Torah, yet are 
		being held together by mutual respect and tolerance for others on their own 
		individual paths of return.</p>
