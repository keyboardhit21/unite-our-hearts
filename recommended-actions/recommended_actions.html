		<P align=justify>All Yahed Levavenu articles mandate actions the
		returnees of the Ten Tribes are to take.&nbsp; We at Yahed Levavenu urge all returnees of the Ten Tribes to partake of these actions for the sake of all Israel and the planet.&nbsp; Though each article has its own implicit and
		explicit recommended set of actions, this list summarizes all the actions recommended by Yached Levavenu at this time.&nbsp;</P>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Thank often, at least once&nbsp;every day, for having been resurrected to be among the first contingent from the
		Valley of Dry Bones.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Acknowledge the G-d of Avraham,
		Yitzchak and Yaakov, as the only author and revealer of true spiritual 
			knowledge.&nbsp;</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Decide that&nbsp;G-d knows best, and be prepared to hear His guidance at any cost regardless of&nbsp;your
		current belief system.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Before, during and after reading the articles, ask the G-d 
			of Israel to speak to your soul about the articles' contents.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Please print out and read all the articles and prayerfully 
			study their references.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Give yourself the benefit of doubt, and accept the 
			challenge of the Elijah message.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Listen for G-d's answers as recommended, and see if they are consistent with His written word
		in the Tanakh and follow them.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Enter upon a personal program of repentance and seek&nbsp; 
			G-d's help with it.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Stand with those who&nbsp;&quot;stand in&quot; for Israel, for her 
			guidance with the Shekhinah, for mercy and for <EM>the spirit
		of repentance</EM> to be&nbsp;poured upon all Israel.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Pray for for those who undertake <EM>the Lechem Panim functions</EM>&nbsp;in the virtual Mishkan 
			of Prayers.</P></li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>Share with Yached Levavenu the answers you receive for personal and collective directions, so&nbsp;that Yahed Levavenu can&nbsp;share them with its readers for the edification of the rest of the returnees.&nbsp; (Please keep notes on your prayers and answers).</P>
			</li>
			<li>
			<P align=justify>If you are convinced that these actions are harmonious with 
			the aims of <a href="http://www.britam.org"> Brit Am</a>, please support Brit Am financially and with daily 
			prayers for its physical and spiritual sustenance. </P></li>
