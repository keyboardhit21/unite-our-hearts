		<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">All returnees are invited to partake of this informal research 
		to look into the manner and method members of the Regathering Movement have 
		their prayers answered. Some receive answers directly during prayer, study, 
		visions or dreams. For the sake of clarity in this research, these are called
		<font color="#FF0000">&quot;Private Revelations,&quot; &quot;PRs&quot; </font>and are designated by 
		orange colored text and indications on this website. They are usually text 
		references from the Tanach.&nbsp; The project&nbsp; is an effort to gather information in order to
		find out what we, &quot;the first contingent to arise from the Valley of Dry
		Bones&quot; need to do individually as well as a group. The answers the project
		hopes to gather will be pointers on Divine Guidance.&nbsp; All members of the
		Unite Our Heart update notification list and all&nbsp; returnees from the Ten
		Tribes are invited to be partakers of it. Manifold participation will help in
		refining the questionnaire for its intended purpose.&nbsp; We intend to publish
		and disseminate the aggregate results of the project.&nbsp; No names or any
		identifying data of participants will be disclosed.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Please fill out a separate form for each prayer to which you
		have received answers.&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">Please block out the form below, and &quot;cut and paste&quot;
		it into Microsoft Word and email it back as an attachment to the address on the
