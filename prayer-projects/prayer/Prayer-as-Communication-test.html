</FONT></P><P>The Mishkan / Tabernacle was called the <I>tent of meeting,</I> because there the two-way communication between Moses, the representative of the congregation of Israel and G-d&#146;s Guiding Presence officially took place, <I>&#147;And there I will meet with you and I will speak with you from above the ark covering from between the two cheruvim.&#148;</I> (Ex. 25:22).  The communication could take place elsewhere also, wherever the Ruach haKodesh / G-d&#146;s holy Spirit inspired those on whom it rested. As in the examples of Eldad and Bedad, it was Moses&#146; wish that all of G-d&#146;s people would be lead by the Ruach haKodesh, (Num. 11:25-29).  G-d spoke with Moshe in a unique &#147;face to face&#148; manner.  We do not know what that exactly was; we know it was a unique communication &#147;face to face,&#148; (Ex. 33:11, Num. 12:8, Deut. 34:10).  We know that it was in a conversation format, as between two individuals.  From this example we know that prayer can be and often should be conducted as a <B>conversation</B>, speaking and listening, in order to seek intimacy with G-d.  It is a mode of praying where we are actively &#147;seeking G-d&#146;s face.&#148; This kind of prayer is a meditative exchange on words we say and words we receive, listening to &#147;the still small voice, (I Kings 19:12), and responding as moved by those words from the heart.  In a way, every prayer should be an attempt to &#147;seek G-d&#146;s face&#148; for this purpose, (Psalm 27:7).  One of the main purposes of Yached Levavenu is to foster the seeking of the G-d of Israel that He may communicate with us. Yached Levavenu hopes and prays for the proliferation of this type of &#147;face to face&#148; communication to develop in the <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">Mishkan of prayers</FONT> between the <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">faithful remnant</FONT> of Israel and the G-d of Israel. 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">Better than we possibly can, G-d knows fully what we are and how our conscious and subconscious processes          operate. 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">                 <I>&#147;O L-rd thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou understandest my thought afar off.  Thou hast measured my going and my lying down, and thou art acquainted with all my ways.  <B>For no word is yet on my tongue and lo, O L-rd, thou knowest it all.&#148;</B></I><B> </B>(Psalm 139:1-4). 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">           G-d can tell us the very words that exactly express our soul&#146;s intent and message before we even try to formulate our utterances. The only way David could have known that was to have experienced G-d reflecting and communicating his desires to David, letting David know that He was tracking with him during his prayers.  To this end in the Morning Service we pray<I>, &#147;O Lord save us; may the King answer us before we call.&#148;</I>  David expected to hear from G-d the very day he made a request, often in the morning, after his initial prayers of the day, (Psalm 143:8).  Go-d may answer us at any time, but often his answers come during morning prayers, when we are charged up with the motivation to give thanks to G-d for having awakened for another day of life and its blessings.  Later in the morning prayers we pray<I>, &#147;From your presence dismiss us not empty handed.&#148;</I>  Sometimes God may tell us at the end of our prayer, the summary of our prayer with a Biblical reference, which better expresses with a few words in a totally encompassing way what we have said with many words. 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">         G-d communicates with us in ways that we are most apt to hear and need to hear.  These words can come from any Biblical reference.  An example of this Divine communication is recorded about the sages rabbi Abbaya and rabbi Rava, who received Biblical verses as answers to their prayers.  Often they come from the Psalms, which encompass the depth and breadth of human experience.  As with the Biblical patriarchs, G-d sometimes communicates in <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">dreams</FONT>, where God bypasses the filtering of our conscious minds (II Chron. 7:12).  His answers may come in words that strike us as we study his Word, in what we may overhear in a conversation, in words and thoughts that come into our minds as we meditate on His Word, in sudden realizations and enlightenments.  These types of answers, as well as page numbers in prayer books, the Tanach and Bible-related books are also possible pointers to answers.  All these forms are genuine if they have one thing in common: being consistent with His written revelation the Tanach, i.e. Torah, the Prophets and the Writings, (Isa. 8:20).  G-d&#146;s answers are always be on target, exact and totally consistent with his written word.  When God answers our prayers concerning weighty matters, it is always at least two times, from different sources that we will hear the answer. This is consistent with the Torah, i.e. in the mouth of <I>two or three</I> witnesses was a matter decided in ancient Israel.  That principle of receiving information from at least two different sources to verify a truth, has not changed.  If we doubt, or do not want to heed the answer, He often answers the third time.  Answers for pleas concerning repentance, spiritual dilemmas and directions tend to be swiftly answered, for it is the most important agenda we can comply with. The whole Tanach&#146;s directive can be summed up in Psalm 90:3:  &#147;Thou turnest man to destruction and sayest <B>return ye children of men.</B>&#148; 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">               Though this closeness and more will  eventually be available to all seekers of the G-d of Israel, it is not in the realm of
</P><P ALIGN="justify">   impossibility  for us now.   This closeness and <I>communion through communion /</I> <I>yechidut</I>  is especially bound
</P><P ALIGN="justify">   to happen now when the gates of repentance are being opened to the House of Joseph: 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">   <I>&#147;<B>Then</B> shall you call upon me, and you shall go and pray to me, and I will hearken to you.  And you shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart.  And I will allow myself to be found by you, says the L-rd: and I will restore you from captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations&#133;&#148;</I>  (Jer. 29:13-14). 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">This closeness is absolutely and especially necessary for those who wish to serve in the manner of modern day <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">lechem panim.</FONT>  G-d promises that before we even speak, he will answer,  (Isa. 65: 24). 
 </P><P ALIGN="justify">   We are commanded to look to our father Abraham, our mother Sarah and to the Rock (G-d) whence we were hewn, (Isa.51:12). At the time of Abraham&#146;s ultimate test, the Akedah, G-d our Eternal Rock, has provided for Abraham the sacrifice, the ram caught in a bush, (Gen. 22:13).  Abraham brought Isaac, his own commanded sacrifice, and G-d has also prepared his own sacrifice for Abraham to use.  Our prayers are to be like that. We are not only to use our own words to express concepts written in the prophecies that G-d taught us from his Word, but also are to listen to G-d&#146;s reciprocation and use words received on the spot as we pray.  This <I>listening and responding</I> is the essence of &#147;face to face prayer.&#148;  
</P><P ALIGN="justify">           The words we say, and the words we receive, through study or prayer, are to be pondered, contemplated and turned over in one&#146;s mind.  They are to be concentrated on in the context we give them and receive them.  Rabbi Yaakov ben Asher, (c. 1340?, Tur, Orach Chaim 98), gives us a description of the &#147;meditative focusing&#148; we ought to do on the words we use in our conversation with G-d:
</P><P ALIGN="justify">&#147;.. you should concentrate on the words that issue from your mouth and should think about <B>G-d&#146;s presence</B> being there&#133; Pay attention and banish any distracting thoughts, so that your mind shall be solely on prayer&#133; This was the practice of the pious and of the enthusiastic; they would linger and concentrate on their prayer until they transcended their physical awareness, and they would be overwhelmed by a spirit of lucidity, and they would come close to prophecy&#133;.&#148; This type of &#147;contemplation / hitbonenut&#148; during the study of G-d&#146;s Word, before and during prayer, gives us the intellectual knowledge and the deep emotional understanding through which we fuse with G-d&#146;s revelation.  During such times we achieve that <I>yechidut / </I>spiritual communion that  we need to prepare us for further inspiration and guidance by G-d&#146;s holy Spirit. 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">            G-d&#146;s Torah teaches us that the sacrifices were to follow specific G-d-given patterns.  In the same vein, like a good teacher,G-d provides and puts the very words, i.e. <I>the calves,</I> we are to use in our minds, in our mouths.  We are to listen to and use those words for they have healing powers in our <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">subconscious psyches,</FONT> to turn us back to the G-d of Israel.  He tells us: <I>&#147;I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace be unto him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith the L-rd, and I will <FONT SIZE="3" COLOR="#0000ff">heal</FONT><FONT SIZE="3"> him,&#148; </FONT> </I>(Isa.57:19).  When G-d gives us the words to use to talk to him with, it is a healing experience.  It heals us where we as a lot most need it  &#151; from our 2700-year-old estrangement from Him.  He is calling all of Israel to healing; those who think they are near, and those who are far from Him.  Ask Him to answer you concerning personal repentance and spiritual direction.  Ask Him to show you where and of what you need to repent.  He will answer you swiftly. 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">  A caveat and an important pointer: 
</P><P ALIGN="justify">This article is not a primer on a flippant approach to prayer and expecting G-d to answer us about trivial, insignificant and mundane matters on which we are to exercise our human reasoning and efforts.  Neither is it advocating a superstitious &#147;magical&#148; disposition and looking for omens and signs.  Rather, it advocates soul-felt persistence in prayer about weighty matters and restoration to communication with G-d for the sake of guidance for the returning Ten Tribes and all Israel.
</P><P ALIGN="justify">This article is not a primer on how to pray in general.  There are many good books on prayer and the Siddur/ prayer book of Yehudah.  Rather it points out the kind of prayer the returning Israelites need to engage in order to receive instruction and directions on how to get out of the ingrained patterns of our corporate and individual sins and mindsets.  To this effect, Yached Levavenu strongly urges readers to pray, i.e. talk to G-d, not just at regular times, but most importantly whenever they are prompted by what they read, study, meditate / contemplate on, and when they are &#147;emotionally moved and prompted by inner urges of one&#146;s spirit.&#148;  These times of emotional movement in one&#146;s inner being are the best times to communicate with G-d, since then we experience the promptings of our subconscious minds, G-d&#146;s Inspiration and the outpourings of our souls.
