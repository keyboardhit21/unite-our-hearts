			<P align=justify>We are blessed to be living in the beginning of the regathering of the Tribes of Jacob, in the <I>teshuvah</I> (return/ repentance) movement of
			our times.&nbsp; At this time, the early contingent of the pioneers of this movement is being called out of their exile in the spiritual wilderness of the nations (Hos.1:6, 8:1, 9:3 & 17). They are journeying homeward to Torah-faith, "one from a city, two from a family," (Jer. 3:15; Isa. 10:20-23). Interestingly, they are coming from both Yehudah and Ephraim. They are repeating the pattern of the two reconnaissance men who <I>returned</I> with an encouraging report about God's promises to the whole nation of Israel (Num. 13:5-16, 14:7-9; Jer.33: 7). They seem to be a very small lot, who will be followed later by the great many of regathered Israel. </P>
			<P align=justify><I>Yached Levavenu</I> is calling attention to the Prophets' summoning us to <B>prepare for what we must do</B> in anticipation of this regathering. This article and this website is an effort to marshal that preparation that the pioneer contingent from the returning Lost Ten tribes can do today. It is calling the early contingent of the returning Ten Tribes, particularly those who wish to reassume not just the name of historical Israel, but also the identity of the more-in depth designation of
			<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> <I>servants of G-d,</I>  </span> by which Israel was to be known among the family of man, (Ex. 4:22). For those, it is of utmost importance to return to the Torah, for whoever does not observe the
			<i> mitzvoth </i> / commandments of the Torah, cannot be in the service of G-d. </P>
			<P align=justify>The Psalms and the Prophets are replete with calling Israel to return to the Torah. Among these is Psalm 78, written to the children of Ephraim in the last days. It is connected to <I>the dark sayings of old, </I>the secrets G-d has told us in ancient days which we were to understand only at the proper time. They remained <I>dark, unsolved riddles,</I> because they were not to be understood till our days. G-d has reserved them unto
			Himself to reveal their meaning to their target population at the appointed time. We, who comprise the first contingent to be awakened from the "spiritually dead" are among the pioneers of that target population, the awakening House of Israel. We are beginning to be enlightened to our identity in history and in the closed prophecies of old:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><I><font color="#000080">"Give ear O my people to my Torah, incline your ears to the words of my mouth. I will open&nbsp;
			my mouth in a parable, I will utter riddles / dark sayings: concerning ancient times, of that which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from the children, relating to the <B>latter generation</B>, the praises of the L-rd, and
			His strength, and His wonderful works that He has done."</font></I> </P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			(Psalm 78:1-4)</font></P>
			<P align=justify>Of these mysteries it is written: <I>"The secret things belong unto the L-rd our G-d, but those things which are revealed belong to us and our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Torah."</I> (Deut 29:29). This saying comes after Moses has reiterated the Covenant, after the section of blessings and curses upon Israel, and before he prophesies of the return of those who will have left the Torah,
			(Deut. 30). Moses tells us that the Covenant was made with all of Israel, whether they were physically present or not. Because Israel is of <I>one</I> <I>soul,</I> the implication for us is that we, (the then-spoken-about future <I>latter generation),</I> are beginning to remember what has been written in our souls at Mt. Sinai. We are beginning to remember that we have agreed to live according to G-d's Torah, (Deut. 29:15, Ex. 24:7). Because we did not listen to G-d's
			instructions to live by his Torah, we were separated unto the evil of the curses in the Covenant. We were cast out of the Land of Promise and our names were blotted out from history, (Deut. 29:20-28).
			Yet, as G-d's servant people in the learning of the <a href="../foundation-articles/quintessential_lesson.html">quintessential
			lesson</a> throughout history, we are His witnesses of the veracity of G-d's
			prophetic words.&nbsp; Of&nbsp; His words in the<i> early </i>prophecies in the
			Torah and the <i>latter</i> prophecies in the books of the Prophets, we will
			say: &quot;It is true!&quot; (Isa. 42: 9-10). <BR><BR>The
			duration of the curse we brought upon ourselves&nbsp;is beginning to be finished, and we are now finding ourselves studying our identity of old, as
			the <I>People of the Covenant</I> / <I>Brit Am</I>, (Isa. 40:2, 42:9, Jer. 30:24). We are finding our identity in the prophesied<I> " dark sayings of old:" "...and thou <B>shalt call them to mind</B> <B>among the nations </B>whither the L-rd thy G-d has driven thee," </I>(Deut. 30:1). These secrets are revealed to us now and <I>"belong to us
			<span style="background-color: #FFFF00"> <B>that we may do all the words of this Torah</B>.</span>" </I>The Torah is the same and the lesson is the same.<I> </I>We have been exiled that we may learn the lesson of our Covenant at Mt. Sinai,
			(Deut. 29:18), and that we may not remain the same, i.e. stiff-necked, not
			willing to hear the Torah and holding on to the gods of the gentiles, (Ex. 34:9,
			Deut. 9:6, 9;13,31:27, 31:20, 29). At the time of our awakening we are to remember that we contemptuously cast away the Torah: <I>"… they have cast away the Torah of the L-rd of hosts and despised the word of the Holy One of
			Israel,&quot; </I><EM>&quot;I have written to him great things of my Torah, but they were counted as a strange thing."&nbsp;</EM> (Isa. 5: 24. 30:9, Hos. 8:3,12).</P>
			<P align=justify>David also prophesied of the time to come, when G-d will not keep silence any more and shall intervene in a very visible manner in the affairs of men:<I> "Offer to G-d a thanksgiving and <B>pay thy vows</B> to the Most High, and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me" (Psalm 50:6-15).</I> G-d is looking forward to the time when we <I>will</I> pay our vows. He also tells us that to be heard for deliverance in times of trouble, one must have paid his vows. G-d is calling us to return to our vows that we made at Mt. Sinai. But how are we to pay our vows, and what vows are we to pay? For prodigal Ephraim, there is only one answer.

We cannot have our names restored, without being put on the path for the eventual restoration of the rest of our being to obedience to the Torah. This is a major part of <FONT color=#0000ff size=3><A href="../foundation-articles/message_of_elijah.html">Elijah's message</A></FONT> to us in the last days. It is also Malachi's last instruction to the entire house of Israel<I>: "Remember ye the Torah of Moses my servant, which I have commanded unto him in
			Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and judgments,"</I> (Mal. 3:22). We are to remember, because we have cast away
			(Ps. 78:10, 37, 69, 81;9), and forgotten the Torah.&nbsp; Because of throwing
			away that foundation of our service, we had our function as servants and priests
			suspended:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><I><FONT size=3 color="#000080">"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be <B>no priest</B> to me: seeing <B>thou hast forgotten the Torah of thy G-d,</B> I will also forget thy children."</FONT></I></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><FONT size=3 color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			(Hos. 4:6)</FONT></P>
			<P align=justify>Jeremiah says that we shall turn to the Torah when we return to the Land, (Jer. 3-14-16). This prophecy when compared to Moses' prophecy of Deut. 30:1-3, probably refers to the masses which shall return in such a manner when the great repentance movements shall sweep our nations. Alternately,&nbsp;or in addition, it may refer to the point many rabbis make that one cannot truly keep [all] the commandments till he returns to the
			Land. Eventually we shall not only be on site&nbsp; connected with many of the commandments, but also shall receive "a new heart," for a deeper devotion, (Deut. 30:6, Jer. 24:7). However, it remains for us now, the first contingent of returnees from the
			Lost Ten Tribes of the House of Israel who are still <B>in the lands of our spiritual exile,</B> to begin to fulfill the prophecy written to us by Moses:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><I><font color="#000080">".....<B>and shalt return unto the L-rd thy G-d, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I commanded thee this day,</B> thou and thy children, with all thine heart and all thine soul. <B>Then</B> the L-rd thy G–d will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the L-rd thy G-d has scattered thee."</font> </I></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			(Deut. 30:3)</font></P>
			<P align=justify>This would indicate that this initial repentance movement is even necessary to 'kick start" the greater return.&nbsp; Solomon prayed for us, giving us wise advice:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><FONT color=#00008b><EM>"If they return to thee with all their heart and all their soul <STRONG>in the land of their captivity....</STRONG> then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place their prayers and supplications ,and&nbsp; maintain </EM></FONT><EM><FONT color=#00008b>their cause [right], and forgive thy people who have sinned

			(II Chron 6:38)</FONT>&nbsp;</EM></P>
			<P align=justify><EM>We can see that first we are to begin</EM> to return to the Torah, and <STRONG>then</STRONG> we will be regathered. The expediency of this great regathering depends on those who are called to return first. There is always a small group of faithful, sometimes called a "remnant," in whose heart is the response to G-d's call to righteousness, (Isa. 8:16-17, 66:5). They are<I> 
			called "sanctuaries</I>" among whom the Torah is sealed; they <FONT color=#0000ff size=3><A href="../prayer-projects/standing_in.html">wait upon the L-rd,</A></FONT> who looks for them and is expecting them to respond when He is calling them,<I> </I>(Isa. 8:14-18).<B><I> &nbsp;

			<P align=justify><B><I> For the last 2700 years we of the Ten Tribes have been in prisons of spiritual darkness.&nbsp;

			The proscribed period of "spiritual" captivity was an extension of the sentence we served starting with our prisoner-of-war captivity by the Assyrians and extended for the next 2700 years over our
			history of spreading into the Western regions (extremities, islands and coasts) of the world. Till our
			awakening today, none called for true repentance because no one knew of what we were to repent and to what we were to return.
			Now, for some the
			&quot;appointed time,&quot; the sentence&quot; of our spiritual captivity is up, and
			we are touched by the new
			wave of spiritual awakening that G-d has sent into the world. (Isa. 40:2). &nbsp;We
