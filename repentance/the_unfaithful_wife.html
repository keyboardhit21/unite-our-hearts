			<P align=justify>Throughout the Torah, the Writings and the Prophets, we 
			encounter terms and metaphors relating to marriage and its vicissitudes.&nbsp; 
			All of them relate to the intimate relationship God has made with Israel in the 
			Covenant. Israel was to become G-d's &quot;my people,&quot; and for Israel, God was to 
			become &quot;my God.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking through Jeremiah, God explicitly tells Israel: "I married you..." and 
			charges that she has turned away from her God, and her husband. (Jer 3:14, 20.)&nbsp; Jeremiah citing 
			the northern house of Israel's adulterous example, warned Judah, the southern 
			house,&nbsp; to repent and return to Him. He warned Judah of how the former was given a "bill 
			[certificate] of divorcement"/&nbsp; <font color="#800000"><font size="4">&#1505;&#1461;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</font><font size="4">

			<P align=justify>We read in the Torah how Moses reiterates to the new generation

			<font face="Times New Roman">(Deut. 27:9).&nbsp;
			</font></i></font><font face="Times New Roman">This was God's original purpose 
			for their existence that He intended them to be &quot;a holy people of God,&quot; (Ex. 
			19:4-8).&nbsp; To remain so, they were not even to inq</font>uire after the
			gods of the gentiles, lest the Land spew them out, and they would be <b> <I>cut off</I>
			</b>from the
			G-d of their people, (Deut. 12:30, 28:58-59, 63-64, Lev.18: 24-30, 20:22).&nbsp; 
			Staying with the metaphor of &quot;marriage&quot; to describe the intimate relationship 
			between himself and Israel, God uses related words, e.g. &quot;adultery&quot; and 
			&quot;divorce&quot; to describe the breakdown of that holy relationship should Israel go 
			after other gods.&nbsp; For this reason the Covenant has its built-in <i>divorce</i>
			<i>clauses.</i>&nbsp; They warn that if Israel reneges on her promises to be faithful, she will be automatically cast out of the Land to be with her lovers, the nations, (Deut. 28:63-64, Jer. 11:8, 
			Hos. 8:9, Ez. 16:33,36, 23:5,9).
			In the ensuing exile to such a breach of the &quot;marriage&quot; Covenant, she will have to stay identified with the nations she wanted to
			imitate and there eat her words. If she went after other gods, she was to be <i>cut off, 
			separated, i.e. divorced,</i> <font color="#000080"> <i>&quot;I had sent her away 
			with a decree [bill] of divorce,&quot; (Jer.3:8).&nbsp; </i></font>This was to be her 
			sentence and fate<font color="#000080"> </font>in order that she may learn the <a href="../foundation-articles/quintessential_lesson.html">quintessential
			lesson.</a><i>.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;Like women who divorce and change their names, 
			likewise God has not allowed the &quot;departing&quot; wife to carry the name Isra-EL, 
			&quot;one who prevails with God.&quot;&nbsp; Their names were to be revoked from their 
			identities and usage according to the provisions of the Covenant to which they 
			agreed, (Deut. 27:15, 26, 29:9-15).&nbsp; They were not to be known as &quot;God's 
			holy people&quot; any more till their &quot;sentence&quot; was all served out &quot;in the 
			latter days&quot; and their rehabilitation has begun. </P>
			<P align=justify>How do we know this to be true?&nbsp; Those prophesied days are 
			here, for&nbsp; we are beginning to have our ears and eyes opened to begin to understand this 
			judgment's whys and wherefores, (Jer. 30:24). It is essential that we know these 
			facts about our sordid history in order to regain our forgotten identity as &quot;the 
			people of God.&quot; We read in the book of Hosea, who by marrying a harlot in real 
			life was to act out the role of God in his marriage to the northern house of 
			Israel, also known as Ephraim in Biblical writings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hosea's children 
			from this union were to be named &quot;prophetically,&quot; to depict Ephraim's sentence.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Because of their refusal to repent of their idolatries, they were not to receive 
			any mercy like Judah was to have:</P>
			<P align=justify><font color="#000080">&quot;And He said unto him: 'Call her name <b>
			Lo-ruhamah [Not having received mercy];</b> for I will no more have compassion 
			upon the house of Israel, that I should in any wise pardon them.'&quot;&nbsp;
			<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213; </font>(Hos.1:6) </font> </P>
			<P align=justify><font color="#000080"><i>&nbsp;&quot;Then said G-d, call his name
			<b>LoAmmi,</b> <b>[Not my people]</b> for ye
			are not my people, and I will not be your G-d.&quot;&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213;</font></i> 
			(Hos. 1:9)</font></P>
			<P align=justify>The Talmud correctly remarks that our
			membership in the legal body of Israel was suspended; and &quot;legally speaking,&quot; we are
			considered by Jews the same as &quot;gentiles&quot; (Yebamot 17). Our spiritual
			connection to our true identity, being <i>the people of G-d,</i> was to be hidden from
			our <i>consciousness </i>for a long time.&nbsp; God has considered destroying 
			Israel all together and thus blotting out our names more than once, since the penalty 
			for&nbsp; idolatry was death:</P>

			<P align=justify>True, many of the offenders died in the Assyrian invasion of 
			the northern house of Israel. They received the physical death penalty then and 
			there. It was all part of the whole house being moved into &quot;spiritual graves.&quot;&nbsp; 
			For the survivor's of God's wrath then, that death penalty was commuted into 
			&quot;spiritual death.&quot;&nbsp; The metaphor for that was the Valley of Dry Bones, 
			where we have been been as &quot;very dry bones.&quot; Yes, very dry, for 2700 years(!)&nbsp; 
			we have not had the life- nourishing moisture of God's Water of Life spiritually

			Israel was temporarily sent away from G-d's land, and was cut off from the benefits of the Covenant in the Land,

			Ahola </I>is a derivative of<I> ohel, i.e. dwelling / tent. </I>Instead of being 
			a tent for the Presence of G-d, the Northern House was to bear the sins of her

			spacious great lands of power with rich resources she inherited for her progeny, (Gen 
			49:22-26, Deut.33:13-17, Isa. 54:2-3). She is prophetically told that though she was put away, God is still her true husband, and will call her back to the Covenant after a little while, 
			(only some 2700 years), and all her children shall be taught of the L-RD, (Hos 2:2, Isa. 54: 5-7,13). They will be taught the Torah, not the ways of "the imagination of their heart,&quot; 
			e.g. their packages of hermeneutics and doctrines which form the patterns of their spiritual exile and grave, (Jer. 13:10-11). G-d makes a point of this, since the House of Israel cannot see straight, and is confusing the G-d of Israel with her adopted savior that she added to and amalgamated with the G-d of Israel.

			<font color="#000080">(Isa. 50:1).&nbsp; </font></i>She is asked this because

			Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Times New Roman">&#8213; </font></i>(Isa. 5: 24)</font></P>
			<P align=justify>She has forgotten the Torah of God (Hos. 4:6). She does not understand that the Covenant is also the bill of divorcement, for it contains the clauses for divorce and for being cut off from G-d, resulting in spiritual death, (Jer. 8-11, Deut. 28-30). She is "joined," i.e. <B>
			Heb. / wedded</B> to idols, (Hos. 4:17). From all the references to another god and "savior" in the book of Hosea, it is quite easy to figure out who their <I>savior</I> is to whom Ephraim is "wedded" and takes pride in. The Northern House of Israel, the people of
			Ephraim / Joseph, are called to come out of this Babylonian [confusing] relationship, and return to the paths of old, (Isa. 42:15, Jer. 6:16, 
			18:15). Israel, who is dwelling and waiting for the Torah <I>in the isles</I> 
			<i> in the latter days,</i> (Deut. 29:4, 22, Isa. 42:4, 10), is called to "hear" 
			/ shema, for they are spiritually deaf (Isa. 30:9, 41:26, 42:18, 43:8). They are called to hear G-d's wake-up call to their identity. 
			Knowing this sacred identity is most important in the wake-up process. Once one 
			knows his identity, one starts to become &quot;self-conscious,&quot; conscious of the true 
			&quot;self&quot; as a child of God. They are also called to hear <FONT color=#0000ff size=3><FONT color=#000000>
			&quot;the Shema</FONT>,&quot;</FONT> that there is no other G-d besides the Holy One of 
			Israel:</P>

			<P align=justify>He is <I>the</I> One who is waking them up at the present. They are called to hear that G-d's firstborn people were not to be split in their consciousness and be joined to other gods, but are to be 
			&quot;one as He is one.&quot;&nbsp; They are also called to <A href="restoration_to_the_torah.html"><FONT color=#0000ff size=3>repentance</FONT>:</A> 
			<font color="#000080"><i>"Turn, O backsliding children, saith the L-rd, for I am married to you," (Jer. 3:14).</i></font> We 
			are among the early returnees from the exile of the Ten Tribes at the end of 
			days.&nbsp; One of our tasks on behalf of all of the House of Joseph, is to ask for the <I>old paths</I>,
			which we have not known, and G-d promises to lead us therein (Isa. 42:16). The implication for the returning tribes today is to note that we,<FONT color=#000000> <FONT size=3>the unfaithful wife</FONT>,</FONT> are to return to faithfulness to that contract, i.e. Covenant, as G-d communicates that directive to us on our individual and collective homeward journeys. This eventual reacceptance of the Torah was prophesied for the whole house of Israel,
			for both the northern House of Israel, and the southern House of Judah, when both houses will reaffirm and reaccept the Marriage Covenant of Israel. Hosea wrote of this grand reunion. Israel's particular return to the Marriage Covenant as G-d's chosen, i.e. 
			&quot;betrothed,&quot; is explicitly prophesied: </P>
			<P align=justify><i><font color="#000080">"And it shall be in that day, saith the L-RD, that
			you shall call me Ishi, [my husband], and shalt no more call me Baali [my master], 
			<font face="Times New Roman">&#8213; </font>(Hos.2: 7, 20).&nbsp;</font></i>
			Ephraim will no longer regard the G-d of Israel as that "harsh, God of the <I>Old </I>Testament Law,&quot; and make an idolatry of the
			&quot;god of grace." Rather they shall realize G-d's kind "grace" and loving kindness always
			has been there for them, spelled out in the &quot;blessings&quot; provisions of the 
			Covenant and the promises of deliverance from the corrective crucible of exile, 
			(Ez. 22:15).&nbsp; They will surely reciprocate in kind to G-d's "kind and friendly" message to them, (Hos.2: 14). This time <FONT color=#0000ff size=3><FONT color=#000000>the <I>split</I></FONT> </FONT>
			between the two houses will be healed. They shall be united with each other to 
			be united to their husband, the Eternal G-d of Israel:</P>
			<P align=justify><font color="#000080"><i>&quot;Behold, the days come, saith the

			&#8213; </font>(Jer. 31:30-33)</i></font></P>
			<P align=justify>It is important to note here, that there is no superseding of 
			the original, so-called &quot;Old Covenant here,&quot; as taught in the packages of mixed 
			truths, lies and errors of doctrinal hermeneutics.&nbsp; Yes, this is the &quot;same 
			old&quot; Covenant that Israel accepted at Mt. Sinai and again between Mts. Ebal and 
			Gerizim. </P>
			<P align=justify>Before that grand formal event, this reacceptance of the Covenant,
			the <i>ketuba / marriage contract</i> is especially relevant to the early individual returnees of the people of Joseph now.&nbsp; Moses pointed out to us that the Covenant was made with 
			<b>all </b>of
			Israel, even with those of future generations, who were not [visibly] present at
			Mt. Sinai (Deut. 29:15). Yet in a way, we were all there, because we are all
			parts of the &quot;one soul&quot; of Israel which was there.&nbsp; All Israelites, be they of
			whatever tribe, whether known to themselves or not, are part of that <i>one</i> <i>soul</i>, 
			one heart.&nbsp; As such, to recover our identity as members of the &quot;spiritually 
			cut off&quot; House of (northern) Israel, we will have to consider the reacceptance 
			of the marriage contract /Covenant of the Torah, by which we ALL had promised to
			faithfully abide. To recover our identities as &quot;Israel, the people of God,&quot; it 
			is not enough to just learn about our roots in history and the Bible. Yes, that 
			is a necessary beginning. To have our forfeited&nbsp;and lost&nbsp; identities 
			restored, it is also necessary to return to the Covenant itself.&nbsp; Therefore 
			for us, the early resurrectees at the end of the age, our &quot;journey homeward&quot; is 
			one of incrementally &quot;espousing&quot; more and more of the tenets of the Covenant 
			into our lives, hearts and souls.&nbsp; This cannot be done all at once after 2700 
			years of gross ignorance and misconceptions about Israel, her God and&nbsp; her 
			covenant with God.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is a process, one of learning, unlearning and 
			doing / living according to the instruction we have been given in the Torah of 
			God.</P>
			<P align=justify>We are given the marriage metaphor to understand the relationship between G-d and His betrothed.&nbsp; It is replete with great mysteries. Yet, they will begin to unfold for us when we understand it as an 
			&quot;everlasting Covenant&quot; and begin to conform to it, (Ez. 16;60, 37:26). The Mishkan's 
			innermost chamber, the Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant.&quot; This is where the Torah, i.e. the 
			Ketuba, the written marriage contract between G-d and his people Israel was kept. 
			It layed out the specifics of This is 
			why the Holy of holies was sometimes referred to by mystics as &quot;The Bridal 
			Chamber.&quot;&nbsp; The cover of the Ark of the Covenant had two winged figures on 
			it, one with a male face and the other with a female face on it. There are many guesses 
			with many good possibilities as to what spiritual principles and relationships 
			they symbolized. The Zohar explains that the mystical meaning of the two winged 
			figures reaching out for each other on the cover of the Ark symbolized the 
			relationship between the God of Israel and the children of Israel. The latter was understood to be standing for the Shekhinah, the soul of Israel, symbolizing all of Israel.&nbsp; For this reason mystical prayers 
			of Judah plead for the eventual reunification of the exiled Shekhinah with the 
			God of Israel.&nbsp; Knowing our identity is only the beginning of our resurrection from the dead. We are
			also to seek <FONT color=#000000 size=3>healing</FONT> and purification that the <A href="../foundation-articles/shekhinah.html"><FONT color=#0000ff size=3>Shekhinah</FONT> <u>

			does not happen, <font color="#000080">&quot;Our hope is lost.&quot; (Ez. 37:11).</font></P>
			<P align=justify>Where are we and what are we to do? If we ask G-d, the Healer 
			of Israel, He will surely tell us, individually and collectively. Our merciful 
			and gracious God will speak kindly to our <FONT color=#0000ff size=3>split</FONT> hearts,
			and heal our backsliding, (Hos. 2:24, 10:2, 14:4). He will guide us with His eye, (Psalm 32:8).<i><font color="#000080">

			conditions will be that will force us to return to our God and His Covenant.&nbsp;
