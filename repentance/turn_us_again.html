			<P align=justify>We are in the in the teshuvah (return/ repentance) movement of
			the prophesied &quot;last days.&quot; As such we are experiencing its most relevant sign,&nbsp; 
			the beginning of the regathering of all the Tribes of Yaakov to the G-d of 
			Israel, to observance of the Torah, to each other, and eventually to the Land. 
			At the beginning of this process, <A href="../prayer-projects/standing_in.html">the early contingent </A>
			of the trailblazers of this movement are being called out of their exile in the spiritual wilderness of the nations (Hos.1:6, 8:1, 9:3 & 17).&nbsp; These 
			pioneers "one from a city, two from a family [clan]," (Jer. 3:15,&nbsp;Isa. 10:20-23) are journeying homeward to Torah-faith.&nbsp; 
			As Jewish traditions maintains, those furthest
			from the Torah are being called to come home first. Interestingly, they are coming from both 
			houses of Israel, Yehudah and Ephraim.&nbsp; They are repeating the pattern of the two reconnaissance men, Yehoshua from Ephraim and Calev from Yehudah, who returned with an encouraging report about God's promises to the whole nation of Israel, (Num. 13:5-16, 14:7-9; Jer.33:7).&nbsp; They seem to be a very small lot, who will be followed later by the great many of regathered Israel. &nbsp;Yached Levavenu as part of this 
			&quot;first contingent,&quot; is calling attention
			to the Prophets summoning us to the preparation we must do in anticipation of this 
			great &quot;end time&quot; regathering of the whole house of Israel..&nbsp; Yached Levavenu promotes this effort to marshal that preparation that the pioneer
			&quot;first contingent&quot; from the physically and spiritually exiled of the
			so-called &quot;Lost&quot; Ten tribes can do today.</P>
			<P align=justify>Patterns for us to note:<BR>On the Day of Atonement / Yom Kippur, a goat chosen by lot, was offered by the high priest to express the coming
			closer of the congregation to the G-d of Israel before entreating Him for forgiveness for the whole nation. However, this communal petition was not to apply to individuals who have not made their own individual repentance first.&nbsp;
			Each individual was to first put his own spiritual house in order for the group's
			petition of&nbsp; forgiveness to apply to him. Likewise, this site asks its readers to order their repentance along individual as well as group lines. This means that those called to wake up first are called to repent of the grave theological / religious sins they inherited from their fathers in the Galut / Diaspora. We cannot repent of sins for others. Rather, we are to repent of the errors bequeathed to us by our ancestors and fathers in the Galut.&nbsp; We are told that
			<i> the nations,</i> [the context implies the nations of Israel in the latter days], will realize they have inherited lies form their fathers, e.g. their religious and political belief systems, their ideals, ways and means contrary to the Torah, (Jer. 16:19). We, the early contingent to arise
			from the <i> spiritually dead,</i> need to verbally confess to G-d, i.e. acknowledge these sins on our behalf <B>and on behalf of our people </B>as Daniel did, (Dan. 9:18-29). He not only confessed <B>on behalf </B>of Yehudah, but <B>acknowledged</B> on their behalf that the curse of exile has come upon them for not listening to the Torah as Moses prophesied, (Dan. 9:5-14).&nbsp; In other words, he was a leader in repentance and prayed
			as an <a href="../prayer-projects/standing_in.html"> intercessor</a> on behalf of his companions in exile.&nbsp; Doing so by us and all concerned Israelites, will bring more Divine intervention
			and Guidance into our midst and speed up our individual and collective Redemption.&nbsp; <BR><BR>We are to repent of our part in these sins, as well as of sins of errors, omission and commission, and
			also of sins regarding our relationships in our daily lives. We are to have clean hands and hearts if we are to approach God upon our awakening (Psalm 24).&nbsp; Hosea reminds us that it is really G-d, speaking prophetically through Yaakov, who told us thousands of years ago what to do in our latter-days' return, (Hos. 12:3). Yaakov, our father instructs us to "be clean and change our garments," i.e. to repent of our personal sins, (Gen. 32:2).&nbsp;
			How much more are we to do so as members of the nation of priests, if we are to come close to HaShem to entreat Him on behalf of Israel as well as the world?&nbsp;
			This is why Yaakov our father, reaching across time, tells us to be clean and change our garments before we show up at
			<i> Beit El,</i> the House of G-d, (Gen. 35:2). We have tasks to do as watchmen&nbsp;concerning the repatriation of the House of Israel to the G-d of Israel. This is why we, the first contingent,&nbsp;have been called out of the Valley of Dry Bones early. We, the pioneer early returnees, have the obligation to set the right pattern of repentance for the myriads of Israel's families to follow.
			We are to strengthen the &quot;ingathered&quot; and those who are being gathered
			to fortify them against the forces of evil who will try to reclaim them.&nbsp; The essence of the order of this pattern for early returnees is embodied in the following three ancient Biblical names whose relevance is revealed to us,
			&quot;the children's children,&quot; in "the latter days:"&nbsp; <BR><BR>1. <STRONG>Eli-Shama,</STRONG> 
			(My <i>G-d hearing</i>, implying <i>My G-d causes to hear</i>), i.e. It points 
			us to a spiritual process with an imperative: &quot;Hear G-d's call to wake up out of the sleep of spiritual death, and spiritual
			forgetfulness of our estrangement from the G-d of Israel.&quot;&nbsp; Further implications 
			are that the Divine wake-up call that awakened all of us from the sleep of 
			spiritual death, has healed our ability &quot;hear,&quot; and now we are to &quot;listen&quot; to 
			what our God has to tell us on &quot;the road of return / repentance.&quot; </P>
			<P align=justify>2. <STRONG>Eli-Yadah,</STRONG> 
			(<i>Knowledge of My G-d,</i> implying<i> My G-d causes to know</i>), i.e. Gain knowledge, i.e. study of who we
			are, our identities and attributes, in the light of the Torah, and <I>acknowledge with thanks </I><A href="../foundation-articles/quintessential_lesson.html">who the true G-d is,</A> where we have been, and what is expected of us now.&nbsp; The Hebrew word <I>yadah has many connotations and </I>can be translated in several legitimate ways. Samson Raphael Hirsch, classical commentators and modern Hebrew dictionaries affirm that <I>acknowledging, confessing, </I>and its extension of <I>"giving thanks</I> because of acknowledging something or
			someone, are legitimate derivatives, if not direct meanings.&quot;&nbsp; To this end, the prophets have forecast that in the latter days we will <A href="../foundation-articles/quintessential_lesson.html">acknowledge</A>, because we will intensely study, i.e. research these identity-related truths in G-d's message to us in the Prophets:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><font color="#000080">"...and you shall call them to mind among all the nations where the L-rd your G-d has driven you,</font></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">(Deut.30:1-2)</font></P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><font color="#000080">"The fierce anger of the L-rd shall not turn back, until he has done it, until he has performed the intents of his heart, in the latter days you shall understand, [consider, i.e. intensely study / research] it.</font></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">(Jer. 30:24)</font></P>
			<P align=justify>This &quot;intensive search&quot; that we are to do is at
				the very core of all instructions that we are commanded to do in the
				Torah.&nbsp; Since the total number of words in the Torah is even, there is
				no middle word. At the very center of the Torah is the space between the
				words DAROSH DARASH (Lev.10:16): <i>&quot;and Moses SEARCHINGLY
				SEARCHED.&quot;&nbsp;</i> Only if we search with great intent, and are
				willing to let go of any resistances to find the truth, will we arrive at
				the knowledge of truth. We do not have to wait till the terrible wake-up calls come
			upon Israel to research our obligations that are part and parcel of our identity as members of the returning House of Israel. We can do that now. We,
				the &quot;first contingent, the advance guard,&quot; can return to G-d now.</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify><font color="#000080">" And you shall seek me and find me, when you shall search for me with all your heart. And I will allow myself to be found by you, says the L-RD: and I will restore you from captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations..."</font></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">(Jer. 29:13-14)</font></P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify><font color="#000080">" Know this day and take unto your heart that G-d is the L-rd, there is none beside Him,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></P>

			<blockquote>
			<P align=justify>Ephraim was admonished by Hosea at the time of their impending
			removal from the Land, to lay emphasis on gaining knowledge of&nbsp; G-d over
			offering of sacrifices.&nbsp; Their knowledge of the worship of G-d was centered on offering
			countless sacrifices as if G-d needed them, as the heathen suppose that they
			could ingratiate themselves to their gods with sacrifices.&nbsp; They mixed the
			worship of the true G-d with the ways of the heathen.&nbsp; Rather, the Creator
			desires that Ephraim lay emphasis of gaining true knowledge which is centered on
			keeping His commandments.&nbsp; Hosea's message from the Creator to latter-day
			Ephraim is still the same :&nbsp; </P>

			(Isa. 49:7-8)&nbsp;</i> <BR><BR></font>The sages of Yehudah have based the hope of the restoration to what the prophets of old have
			prophesied, and that it comes due to G-d's mercy on us&quot; </P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"Therefore thus says the L-RD G-d, ‘Now I shall restore the fortunes of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I shall be jealous for My holy name.'"</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Ez. 39:25) </P>
			<P align=justify>Bible commentator Rashi tells us that when the final redemption comes, the assimilated hidden ones of Israel will be reunited with the rest of the nation and be restored to the status of their forefathers. Commentator Ramban states that "until they are restored to the status of their fathers and returned to their place, their redemption is not complete.&quot;&nbsp;
			These sages only comment on what Moses prophesied of this time:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"It will be when all these things come upon you - the blessings and the curses that I have presented before you - then you will take it to heart among all the nations where the L-rd, your G-d has dispersed you, and you will return to the L-rd your G-d, and listen to His voice, according to everything that I command you today, you and all your children with all your heart and all your soul." </P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Deut. 30:1-3)</P>
			<P align=justify><BR>Jeremiah also has prophesied of Israel that: "they shall return with their <B>whole heart.</B>" (Jer. 24:7). This
			<i> whole heart</i> return implies asking for and submitting to a Divine healing, through a
			Divine operation, a Divinely performed circumcision, where the barriers to Divine guidance on one's heart are
			Divinely removed:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"The L-rd your G-d will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring, to love HaShem you G-d with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live, </P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Deut. 30:6) </P>
			<P align=justify>It will be the time when G-d will have ceased from hiding His face from us:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"And I will not hide my face from them any longer, for I shall have poured out my Spirit on the House of Israel, declares the L-rd,"</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Ez. 39:29)</P>
			<P align=justify>If this "outpouring of the Spirit" is eventually to come upon the whole House of Israel, it can certainly come upon the early returnees NOW, if we ask for it on an individual basis. Once we set our hearts to repent and follow G-d's directives with a no-holds-barred attitude, G-d adds the curative factor / ingredient to the repentance process. This additive is called the "circumcision of the heart." Physical circumcision, performed by man, is a sign of being inducted into the Commonwealth of Israel, and the taking on the obligations of the Covenant. For physical humans it also permits a fuller contact with the feminine <I>"help meet" </I>and thusly mirrors a pattern for the spiritual transaction the physical act pictures. In the process of repentance in humans, spiritual "circumcision of the heart" is performed by G-d and means the removal of the spiritual impediment to contact with Divine Help.&nbsp; Because the "natural barrier," i.e. the inborn resistance of the human heart to G-d's leading is removed, it can more fully&nbsp;be in contact with the inspiration and influence of the "feminine powers" of the Spirit of G-d.&nbsp;
			It is then that the human [higher] spirit of man is able to begin to unite with the guiding Spirit of G-d, and realize its truly creative potential for the holy ensoulment of man . <BR><BR>The sages of Yehudah discovered the divinely ordained principle that "if one comes to purify himself, he is assisted by G-d," (Shabbat 104a). Though the full scope and implications of this principle in the process of&nbsp; ultimate repentance, the "circumcision of the heart," will not unfold till the coming of the Messiah, the process can begin NOW with us, the awakening pioneers of the <I>early contingent</I> from the Valley of Dry Bones, (Ez. 37). Who is the <I>early contingent?</I> They are those who have come into an awareness of Israelite identity up to now and who are feeling a pull in their hearts to return to faithfulness to the Covenant.&nbsp; Individuals and small groups within this diverse collection, are on various levels of understanding what it means to <I>return to G-d and </I>to His Covenant.&nbsp; Regardless of who we are, where we have come from,
			in what group we find ourselves upon our awakening, or where we are on our
			<i> journey of "return to G-d and His Covenant,"</i> G-d's vital assistance with repentance is available to us now. Though we do not have the physical Mishkan where 
			G-d's helping Agency, the <A href="../foundation-articles/shekhinah.html">Shekhinah</A>, was manifestly available to assist us in a visibly spectacular manner, we do have G-d's promise that He is with us in a " minor manifestation" of His Help, in the exile we are in now:&nbsp;</P>

			<P align=justify>Though that Help, may be in minor manifestation, i.e. not readily visible as it was in the Mishkan / Tabernacle, the effective might of that Help is unlimited. It is the Agency that will bring us out of our spiritual captivity.&nbsp; Moses wrote of G-d's Agency <I>bringing us back</I>: "...the L-rd will <I>bring back</I> [i.e. because He is <B>with</B> us], your captivity and have mercy upon you..." (Deut. 30:3). The word for <EM>bring back</EM> here is the unusual use of the word <EM>v'shav</EM>. It implies that G-d Himself, (as it were), was to be in exile and will return from exile with the captives of Israel. Of course this refers to His revealed Presence, the guiding force of his holy Spirit. Ezekiel tells us that the return of G-d's guiding Presence and the pouring out of the His
			Spirit upon Israel&nbsp; will be parallel events, (Ez. 39:29).&nbsp; Though the full manifesting glory of His Presence for all to see, which departed from the first Temple (Ez. 10:18-19, 11:22-23), will not return till later, the pouring out of his holy Spirit upon the pioneering remnant can be had <B>before</B> that time. The revelation of that guiding Presence is available to us now, if <B>we</B> turn our face to him and call upon him earnestly to guide us with his eye, (Psalm 32:8). For that to begin, <B>we</B> have to turn our faces toward Him for He has opened the gates of repentance for us. We can do that by taking on the task for the early contingent.&nbsp; It is our job, the job of the early returnees of the early contingent, to ask that G-d 
			that He begin with us the process of the circumcision of the heart. Thusly we can be enabled to become the foundation of the repentance movement among the Ten Tribes. We have already been placed on that schedule by virtue of the fact of our awakening. It is our task to recognize and acknowledge that
			responsibility and respond to His calling by heeding the injunctions of the Prophets.&nbsp; <BR><BR>"According to the Prophets, the spiritual and moral foundations will have to be laid before the rehabilitation of our people can take place" (The World of Prayer, Vol. 1, Rabbi Elie Munk, Feldheim Publishers, 1963, p. 126).&nbsp; This foundation is preparation with prayer and by seeking repentance to receive the Messiah of Israel, who comes specifically <SPAN style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff00">to the repentant
			ones of Yaakov </SPAN>(Isa.59:20). Speaking specifically to the people of Joseph, Amos tells us how to prepare for this rehabilitation:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"Seek good and not evil, that you may live, and so the L-rd, the G-d of hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken.&nbsp; Hate the evil and love the good, establish justice in the gate; it may be that the L- rd G-d of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph."</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Amos 5:13-15)</P>
			<P align=justify>The Prophets predict this seeking and searching for His ways:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"...afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek the L-RD their G-d, and David their king, and shall come trembling to the L-RD and His goodness in the latter days"</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Hos. 3:5)</P>
			<P align=justify><BR>We, the early returnees, can search for our king David now to lead us with his instructions for us in the prophetic Psalms. He specifically speaks to the progeny of Joseph:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"Give ear O Shepherd of Israel that leadest Joseph like a flock, thou who art enthroned upon the keruvim, shine forth. Before Ephraim, Benjamin and Menashe stir up thy might, and come and save us. Restore us, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved. O L-rd G-d of hosts, how long will thou be angry against the prayers of thy people?"</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Psalm 80:1-4)</P>
			<P align=justify>Who but the early returnees of the remnant of Joseph, and those of Yehudah who will join in the pleading, will pray to G-d with these words? Hosea tells us to: </P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"Take with you words, and turn to the L-rd, say unto Him, take away all iniquity and receive us graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips."</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Hos. 14:2)</P>
			<P align=justify>David teaches us to entreat G-d: </P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"Turn us O G-d of our salvation, and cause thy anger toward us to cease,"</P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Psalm 85:4)</P>
			<P align=justify>At this time we are to 
			<a href="../prayer-projects/prayer/Confession%20Prayers%20VII.pdf"> <B>confess</B> 
			</a>our <a href="../foundation-articles/quintessential_lesson.html"> sins,</a> corporate and private. King David set us the example with his own repentance and tells us today what to do:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"I <B>acknowledged</B> my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgression unto the L-rd and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. <B>For this shall everyone that is godly pray unto thee,</B> <B>in a time when thou mayest be found..."</B> </P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Psalm 32:5-6)</P>
			<P align=justify><BR>David tells us that we too can receive Divine Guidance like the priests and prophets of old:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"... Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those invoking His name, called upon the L-rd and He answered them. Out of the pillar of cloud He spoke to them; they observed his precepts and His ordinances which He gave to them." </P>
			<P class=passage-ref align=justify>(Psalm 99:6-8)</P>
			<P align=justify>As with Moses, Aaron and Samuel, the prophetic Spirit will also be given to us in the 
			<a href="../foundation-articles/mishkan.html">Mishkan of prayers</a> for the direction of Israel as we return to the observance of &nbsp;His Torah, statutes and ordinances. It will also be given to us individually now. After 2700 years of having his face turned away form us, G-d has opened to us the gates of repentance, and pleads with us to come to Him for forgiveness for our corporate and individual sins. He already started the process by turning his face toward us and waking us up. We are expected to turn to Him, when He begins to draw near to us (Isa. 54:7, 55:6-7).&nbsp; Then we can start a reciprocal dialogue and interaction with God as we walk the paths of the Torah restored to us. It is time for us to reciprocate, turn our faces toward him, and ask Him for the Divine assistance of His holy Spirit to prime us with spiritual energy to enable us to repent and return to his Him. </P>
			<P align=justify>It behooves all awakening Israelites of the Ten Tribes, and especially those who wish to <A href="../prayer-projects/standing_in.html"><FONT color=#0000ff>stand in</FONT></A> and plead for mercy for Israel as modern day <EM>lechem panim,</EM> to seek out the G-d of Israel for his Divine forgiveness, guidance and enabling to repent. This service by the few is much needed because <STRONG>"all sacred acts require summoning"</STRONG> (Ibid, Munk, p. 90).&nbsp; This is so because, "like the recognition of truth, <EM>teshuvah /</EM>repentance, requires divine assistance.&nbsp; "If a man is filled with earnest desire to return, then God helps him" (Talmud, Tractate Yoma 38b).&nbsp; Benjamin Franklin advised us likewise: "G-d helps those who help themselves." We humans grossly underestimate our own spiritual powers.&nbsp;While it is true that we are weak as a worm, (Isa. 41:14), with Divine strength added to us, like to our father <A href="../foundation-articles/wrestling_emotions.html">Yaakov at the river Yabbok,</A> we can also prevail over the greatest of evil forces, and most importantly over our own evil inclinations.&nbsp; Many &nbsp;believe that "if we pray <I>hard enough,</I>" G-d will act.&nbsp; In truth, if we pray <I>with sincere devotion and desire,</I> then G-d will bless us with strength from His holy Inspiration to enable us to act for ourselves.&nbsp;Because most do not pray and practice to this end, we continue to languish away in spiritual exile. Though G-d by His grace and mercy has already started to wake us up without any initiative on our part, the ready continuance and peacefulness of the process depends on advancing on our spiritual journeys and coming near to Him.&nbsp; Doing so by the few 
			called now, will not only speed up the process of redemption, but will also mitigate Divine corrective judgments on the many&nbsp; (Isa. 41:1, 48:8-9; Mal. 3:22-24). It is clear that early mercy will be extended to us IF WE REPENT OF OUR SINS AND RETURN TO THE TORAH. Our repentance will 
			hopefully contribute to the rest of Israel's awakening to escape and ride out the harsh wake-up calls to come upon Israel and the 
			whole world.</P>

			wished to emulate the gentiles, they were sentenced to worship other gods till the Redemption:</P>
			<P class=passage align=justify>"And it shall come to pass when thou shall show these people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, wherefore has the L-RD pronounced all this great evil upon us, or what is our iniquity, or what is our sin that we have committed against the L-RD our G-d, then shall thus say unto them, because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the L-RD, and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my Torah, and you have done worse than your fathers, for behold you walk everyone after the stubbornness of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me. Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither you nor your fathers, and there shall you serve other gods day and night, where I will not show you favor."</P>

Jeremiah prophesied that we would continue serve other gods once we were cast out of the Land. This servitude to the philosophies of the gods of the gentiles was to last till the last days. From the time Israel disappeared into the land of Assyria, they were to worship in the houses of foreign gods, (Jer. 31:15). These gods have blinded us to seeing, hearing and walking according to G-d's directives, (Psalm 115:1-9, Hos. 4:17). These gods have also caused our spiritual deaths. Though her children number by the millions, Rachel weeps for them, for they are dead, spiritually dead. (Jer. 31:15). Rachel's weeping, is a "prophetic weeping," for Jeremiah describes her voice coming out of Ramah. Ramah was the headquarters of the prophetess Deborah when she ruled as judge of Israel. From there she gave her inspired guidance and prophecies concerning the tribes of Israel.
			Likewise Rachel, the mother of Joseph and Benjamin sends her mourning cries through the corridors of time to us. She tells us that "we are not," i.e. spiritually viable. This is in line with the Jewish custom of mourning a family member who has "converted out" of the faith of Israel. Those members have been&nbsp; traditionally counted as dead. The history of our 2700 year-old spiritual captivity in the philosophies, replacement theologies and mind-sets of&nbsp;
			<FONT color=#0000ff><A href="http://www.lttn.org/R4_Article2_SteveMathe_Chanukah.htm">"Galut Edom / Yavan,"</A></FONT> i.e. the
			spiritual captivity of the Occidental World is suffused with Greco-Roman ideals. Our long history of estrangement from the G-d of Israel has <EM>bound (Hebrew: havur / joined, wedded)</EM> us to idols, (Hos. 4:17). We will need direct Divine intervention in our mindsets, in our individual and collectives subconscious minds,&nbsp; indeed in the very core and matrix&nbsp; of our lives, in order to recognize them and to be
			loosened from them. <BR><BR>This allegiance is what we are to repent of as a group; the idolatries we have all taken part of since we were cast out of the Land. Today we may not have the wood and stone idols of old, although in some quarters they still persist. Modern idols of our western world may be the excessive pursuits of the luxuries, entertainments and shallowness of our age: sports, food, thrills, anything and everything that takes our minds and focus off G-d and His Torah. While these activities may be acceptable in moderation and on occasions in their proper place, it is their frivolous and addictive use and their perversities that define them as idols. More insidious idols are the secular philosophies that dominate our age, mostly the liberal and or exploitative philosophies of life and governance which pervert and replace the values and precepts of the Torah. These governing currents are also prevalent in religious beliefs. Of these idols the spirit of unbelief is the worst Baal of them all. It is most prevalent in our times. In essence, it is the idolatry of one's self, our own strength and our own power, our refusal to rely on G-d. Jeremiah depicted unbelief as an ingrained grievous sin: "... written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond, it is graven on the table of their heart." (Jer. 17:1). Its effect is also grievous: "Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes his flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the L-rd.... Blessed is the man that trusts in the L-rd and whose hope the L-rd is. (Jer. 17:5,7). To one degree or another, we are all contaminated by these idols of our time.
			Therefore, we ALL need to ask the G-d of Israel <B>to enable</B> us to repent. G-d describes us as "sick" (Ez. 34:16), and we all need the Divine Doctor to diagnose and enlighten us to where we need cleansing of these hidden sins.</P>
